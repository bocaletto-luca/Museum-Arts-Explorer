## Overview

**Museum Art Explorer** is a free and open-source web application that allows users to search, explore, and view detailed information on artworks from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection. The app uses the [Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)—a fully free API that requires no registration—and is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.

## Features

- **Dynamic Artwork Search:**  
  Users can enter any keyword (e.g., "sunflowers") to search for artworks available in The Met’s collection.  

- **Detailed Artwork Information:**  
  Displays key details, including artist name, artwork title, medium, dimensions, department, and culture.  

- **Fullscreen Modal for Details:**  
  Clicking on an artwork opens a fullscreen modal with high-resolution images and additional metadata.  

- **Pagination for Large Results:**  
  If the search returns many results, the app paginates them, displaying 12 artworks per page.  

- **Uniform Display:**  
  Artwork cards have a fixed height, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing layout.  

- **100% Free & Open Source:**  
  Uses free APIs and open-source technologies—no registration or API keys required.  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and semantic markup.
